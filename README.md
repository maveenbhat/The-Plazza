# The-Plazza-C++

This project is to make you realize a simulation of a pizzeria, which is composed of the reception that accepts new commands, of several kitchens, themselves with several cooks, themselves cooking several pizzas.

Through this project I learnt to deal with various problems, including load balancing, process and thread synchronization and communication.

The reception must be started using the command line the following way:
```bash
./plazza 2 5 2000
```
